# MasterJS_Udemy
Udemy JS Master Exercices (Victor Robles).

This repository will be used to learn modern JavaScript, TypeScript and some of its frameworks & libraries such as JQuery or MEAN Stack (MongoDB + Express JS + Angular + NodeJS).

I'll be using in parallel Git and GitHub in order to get used to this way of working in team.
